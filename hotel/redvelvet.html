Step 1
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour three 10 inch round pans.

Step 2
Cream 1/2 cup of shortening, 1 1/2 cups of white sugar, eggs, 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract, and 1 teaspoon of butter flavored extract in a large bowl.
 Make a paste of cocoa and food coloring in a small bowl and add to shortening mixture. 
 Pour in 2 1/2 cups flour alternately with the buttermilk, mixing until just incorporated.
  Mix 1 teaspoon of salt, baking soda, and vinegar in a small bowl, and while fizzing fold into the batter;
   mixing just enough to evenly combine.
    Pour the batter into prepared pan.

Step 3
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes.
 Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.

Step 4
To make frosting:
 Cook 3 tablespoons of flour, 1/2 teaspoon of salt, and milk in a skillet over low heat,
stirring constantly, until thick.
Let cool completely. Cream butter, 1 cup sugar, and 1/2 cup shortening in a separate bowl.
Stir in 2 teaspoons each of vanilla extract and butter flavored extract.
Then add flour mixture to bowl and cream together. Frost cooled cake.
